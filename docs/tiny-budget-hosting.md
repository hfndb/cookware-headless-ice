# Tiny budget hosting

Back to [main page](../README.md).

This project can be used to generate socalled [static websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design#Generated_content). The main advantage of static websites is that they can be lightning fast. If there was enough attention for writing [compact files](./philosophical/compacting-files.md) and so forth.

Such websites can be one page, or grow towards large volumes as with reference or study material. Budget to get such material online can be a problem. So... in case of budgets from practically zero growing to what is really necessary, how do options for hosting of such a website look like?


## Hosting at home

In case you have a computer running 24/7, and a stable internet connection, that can be used to expose a website to others.

**Points of attention:**

+ Yearly expenses: Domain registration, like sample.com. Prices start at approx. $10 or €10 yearly. Though some providers also hand out free subdomains like yourname.sample.com.
+ Domains are connected to one or more IP numbers using DNS registration. Domain providers offer a control panel for such configuration.
+ You'll need to fiddle with port forwarding in your router, to route incoming request to the proper computer.
+ The computer you use needs to run a webserver, like [Nginx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx) or [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server).


## Hosting elsewhere

Many providers all over the world offer tiny budget web hosting, known as [shared web hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service). Enough for static websites. Speed to access a web page can drop depending on server load and server speed. Prices start at $5 or €5 monthly.

For writing content of web pages, a [content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) (CMS) can be used. Like the Open Source package Drupal. Read more about that [here](./cms/drupal.md).

In case of more budget and experience with server administration, a [virtual private server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) (VPS) can be used. Prices start at $10 or €10 monthly.
