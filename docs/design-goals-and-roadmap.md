# Design goals and roadmap

Back to [main  page](../README.md).

## Project philosophy

First of all... I am a thankful user of Open Source Software. Like various flavors of Linux. Having started (for real) with the [Amiga OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga), MS Windows felt retarding and Linux like catching up.
Anyway... contributing an Open Source project is like 'giving back'. With pleasure.

Project specific:
+ File and language processing should be independent of text editors and code editors, which are designed and built for... editing.
+ Switching to another editor shouldn't imply installing a bunch of extensions and extensive configuring before you are up and running. Individual independence rocks!

To those who know about the philosophical debate about [strong vs. loose typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing), like in [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/stop-bringing-strong-typing-to-javascript-4da0666cba6e):

I've worked with strong typing, like in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) (Sun Microsystems), but prefer to write socalled 'loosely typed' code.
Comparing [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#DYNAMIC) with psycho-logic, 'dynamic typing' feels more natural than rigid approaches.

Traditionally it is said that learning to control the elements 'makes' you a master.
Though getting to know them better and controlling isn't enough.
You'll sure as hell need to know what you are doing, otherwise you'll create your very own hell.
And with that, hell for others.
See [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality), cause and effect.
Learn from errors, no matter where they come from.
There's more to life and love than logic, procedures, rules, technology etc.


## Technical design goals

+ One integrated environment for the production of Node.js local and server-side applications, static websites, PDF and ePub, which also handles related technologies like Sass, Flow and TypeScript.

+ [Headless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_software), meaning console based.

+ Higly configurable. All configuration in one .json file in the project root - which was initially successful apart from the TypeScript tsconfig.json file which some might need for [type checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing#Static_type-checking). During further development it turned out this one file with settings can become quite large and therefore specific settings are put in the dev directory.

Enjoy the ride! Or better, in view of the project name, enjoy 'cooking' your code!


## Current statistics

As per 27-12-2021, this project took 416.25 hours and integration of 44 existing Node.js packages, published by others. This includes learning TypeScript, package selection, software architecture, developing, testing, finetuning and adding features.

A summary of code statistics generated by this application:

## Road map

+ Beautifying code using [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) - a pure JavaScript implementation - works smoothly. However, it seems integration of a Rust project could increase speed. [Used languages](./languages.md) mentions that.
+ Transcompiling Sass using the [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) is depricated. The succesor, [Dart Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) still needs to be implemented. Interacting directly with the [binary](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass) using the command line interface would make transcompiling blazingly fast.
+ Transcompiling TypeScript using the [Microsoft compiler](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download) proved to be terribly slow and quite memory consuming. [Babel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/core) improved that using a pure JavaScript implementation. Next step would be transcompiling by a Rust project to further increase speed. [Used languages](./languages.md) mentions that.
+ For HTML templating, [Nunjucks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nunjucks) is integrated. The code is prepared for implementation of other template engines, which should be simple.
+ Implementation of ePub isn' t done yet. First the 'production lines' towards ready to use HTML and PDF output must prove beyond any doubt that they are stable. ePub will next.
+ Perhaps implement running in Windows boxes too?
