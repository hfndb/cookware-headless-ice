# Built-in Artificial Intelligence

In `cookware-headless-ice` you can find a little [Artificial intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). Not socalled [strong AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI), but [weak AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AI) for specific tasks.

One task for which weak AI is used is [sponsoring of source code](./sponsoring.md) betweeen projects. There, `cookware-headless-ice` has a 'learning ability' to learn about what you have learned.

Generic code files represent what you have learned and have done with that. `cookware-headless-ice` will scan such files, copied to the generic repository, looking for usage (imports) of other generic code files. And add them to the configuration file sponsor.json.

While scanning all of those files, `cookware-headless-ice` will also look for npm packages which still need installation, or updates, and report relevant details to you.

Weak AI like this is like [Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) if somebody else would perform these tasks instead of `cookware-headless-ice`.
