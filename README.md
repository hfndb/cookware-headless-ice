**cookware-headless-ice** is a console based working environment, constructed as a [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) project. Like a chef, you can use this gear to 'cook' your own code for projects. So... in Case Of Emergency (ICE), feeling an itch to write some code, you could use this 'integrated cooking environment' (ice) ðŸ˜‰

For background information like **project philosophy**, see [design goals and roadmap](./docs/design-goals-and-roadmap.md).

The **command line toolbox**
+  transcompiles (changed or new) [Sass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_%28stylesheet_language%29) files to [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wikiCascading_Style_Sheets),
+  transcompiles (changed or new) [Flow](https://flow.org/) and [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) files to [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript),
+ generates Sass and JavaScript files with definitions of configured colors and looks, the JavaScript for standalone tools colors.html and project.html in./dev/local-tools/,
+ generates [tag files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags#Tags_file_formats), using [ctags-exuberant](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) or [universal-ctags](https://ctags.io/) (more details, see [here](./docs/configuration.md)),
+ renders (changed or new) template based HTML-content to static .html disk files,
+ [lints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) HTML content files,
+ generates a .xml [Google sitemap](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en),
+ generates a date-time stamped project overview (see below),
+ renders (plain or PGP signed) PDF, in the future perhaps also ePub files,
+ generates [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) documentation for JavaScript and TypeScript files in HTML format,
+ creates automatic backups of changed files, using a time interval.

The **local development server**
+ renders HTML and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files on the fly, without caching to disk files,
+ transcompiles (changed or new) Sass, Flow and TypeScript,
+ generates tag files.
+ lints HTML,
+ displays a *system home page*, providing access to:
  - a project *todo list*,
  - a *project overview*, with files, statistics and a count of integrated Node.js packages, and
  + a documentation browser, to project and system README.md files, and README.md files in integrated Node.js packages.

**Other**
+ In the dev/local-tools directory you'll find some tools to play with colors and styles.


This project is developed on a Linux platform and should also run on BSD and Apple platforms. With some additional effort on Windows too ðŸ˜‰ See [contribute](./docs/contribute.md).


## Prerequisites

**Windows boxes**: Look [here](./docs/installation-windows.md) for prerequisites, installation and usage.
Please note that installation in Windows boxes is not tested yet. See [contribute](./docs/contribute.md).

Installation of prerequisites in **Linux and Apple** boxes:
```
apt-get install git gitk nodejs nodejs-doc npm pgpgpg gpgsm kgpg mplayer
```

For PDF file creation, download and install [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html).
Note: Do not use the version delivered by your package manager, since it has less functionality.

For testing and TypeScript convenience, install global packages; might be executed as root user:

```
$ npm install -g jsdoc mocha typescript ts-node dts-gen
```

In case you experience problems while installing global packages, look [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally).


## Installation

The advised way to install is git cloning or downloading:

```
$ cd /opt
$ git clone https://github.com/hfndb/cookware-headless-ice
$ cd cookware-headless-ice
$ npm install
$ npm build
```

Add an alias like below in your ~/.bashrc, for your convenience:

```
alias cookware=/opt/cookware/bin/starter.sh
```

You might want to change the default configuration. Details about configuration [here](./docs/configuration.md).


## Update

Some packages might complain after some time, that they are outdated. In that case run:


```
npm run-script update # To update package browserlist postcss node-sass

npm run-script rebuild-sass # To only update the sass binary
```

Install missing packages (dependencies), incremental update installed packages if needed:

```
npm run-script update-deps
```


## Usage

+ Start development server:

	```
	$ cookware -r
	```

+ Overview of commands to run another tool:

	```
	$ cookware -h
	```

+ Run tests (JavaScript):

	```
	npm test
	```

+ Run tests (TypeScript, slower):

```
	npm run-script test:ts
```
